I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at in the Physics and Astronomy department at Clemson University with extensive experience in data analysis and coding. My list of scientific publications can be found through [NASA ADS Abstract service](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=docs(ad954e1543ba0039fc59b908b6149892)&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0). I am now looking to transition into the data science or quantitative analysis fields where I can apply my skills and knowledge to solve challenging problems.

Throughout my academic career, I have developed a strong foundation in physics, mathematics, and statistics. I have also gained expertise in a variety of programming languages such as Python and C++, as well as data analysis tools including Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy. My research has focused on analyzing complex data sets to understand the properties of dark matter, galaxies, and other astrophysical phenomena.

As a researcher, I have honed my ability to work both independently as well as part of large international collaborations. I have a demonstrated ability to communicate complex ideas in a clear and concise manner. I have also developed a passion for learning new skills and techniques, and I am always eager to explore new areas of knowledge.

Now, I am looking to apply my skills and experience to a new challenge in the data science or quantitative analysis fields. I am excited to join a team where I can collaborate with colleagues to develop innovative solutions to complex problems, and where I can continue to learn and grow as a professional.
