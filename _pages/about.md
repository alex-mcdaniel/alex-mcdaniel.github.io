I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at in the Physics and Astronomy department at Clemson University. My research is broadly in high energy astrophysics and astro-particle physics. I have made use of telescopes such as CHandra and XMM-Newton at X-ray energies, and Fermi-LAT at gamma-ray energies. To see my list of publications please visit my see [NASA ADS Abstract service](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=docs(c806375407753ab538d40899914c25dd)&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=WH3qKPUAAAAJ). 


I am currently in the process of making a career transition into industyry, looking for a data science/analysis role or other position where I can utilize my skills and knowledge base in programming, data analysis, and research.

In my free time I enjoy being outdoors; hiking, cmaping, spending time at the lake/beach.
