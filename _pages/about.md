<h2>Data Science, Analytics, and Machine Learning</h2>
Having spent the past several years developing data analysis and science skills, I am currently transitioning to a career in the Data Science/Analysis or Machine Learning fields. I am excited to bring my experience extracting meaningful insights from data and extensive knowledge in statistics and mathematics to new challenges outside of academia. To get a sense of how I have applied my knowledge base to topics outside of my academic work you can visit my [Projects](https://alex-mcdaniel.github.io/projects/) page, where I show some of the things that I have been interested in learning more about related to data science, machine learning, and data visualization.

<h2>Astrophysics Research</h2>
My current position is as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Physics and Astronomy department at Clemson University (go Tigers!). My research is broadly in high energy astrophysics and astro-particle physics. Over the past several years I have spent a good deal of time studying particle dark matter, cosmic ray propagation, galactic winds, and sites of cosmic-ray acceleration in the Milky Way. I have made extensive use of data from telescopes such as Fermi-LAT at gamma-ray energies as well as Swift, Chandra, and XMM-Newton at X-ray energies. To see my list of publications please visit the [Publications](https://alex-mcdaniel.github.io/publications/) page of this site, the [NASA ADS Abstract service](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=docs(c806375407753ab538d40899914c25dd)&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0), or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=WH3qKPUAAAAJ).
