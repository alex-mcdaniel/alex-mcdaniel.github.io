In this project we are analyzing a dataset from a fictional auto company's HR records to build a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company. The problem background is as follows:

<blockquote>
<h3>Salifort Motors Employee Retention</h3>


<h4>About the company</h4>
Salifort Motors is a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer. Its global workforce of over 100,000 employees research, design, construct, validate, and distribute electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-based vehicles. Salifortâ€™s end-to-end vertical integration model has made it a global leader at the intersection of alternative energy and automobiles.     


<h4>Your business case</h4>
As a data specialist working for Salifort Motors, you have received the results of a recent employee survey. The senior leadership team has tasked you with analyzing the data to come up with ideas for how to increase employee retention. To help with this, they would like you to design a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their  department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and any other data points you deem helpful.
