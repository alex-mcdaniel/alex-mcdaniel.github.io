While a PhD student at UC Santa Cruz back in 2019, I participated in a colaborative porject that paired UC Santa Cruz physicists with local area artists. The goal of the project is best summarized by the organizer Stephanie Bailey:


<blockquote>This collaboration aims to enable people to access and engage with physics through art and to think about the role physics plays in their lives and the world at large. It provides meaningful creative and intellectual experiences for the general public and for participating artists and scientists. This is a way to bridge local community with UC Santa Cruz and foster innovative exchange between two of Santa Cruz's great cultural strengthsâ€”our thriving scientific and artistic communities.

I was paired with the wonderfully talented kiln-fired glass artists Randie Silverstein (check out her site at ). 


More information on the project (and great art!) can be found at the project website: <a href="https://slbailey109.wixsite.com/fusion/about">The Fusion of Art & Physics</a>

As part of the project, my artist collaborator and I were interviewed by local newspapers and radio stations. For a few of accessible examples:
