This page will eventually include some of the projects I worked on as part of the <a href="https://www.clemsongis.org/engineering-and-environmental-gis-s">GIS Fundamentals Workshop Series </a> I participated in at Clemson University. This workshop offered >30 hours of hands on training using ArcGISPro to explore various GIS topics.

A few of the project are hosted through ArcGIS online:

<a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/63a1228dbf1848feaff636c38a873bac">Enivisioning Risk: Understanding the Effects of Climate Change Story Map<a>
