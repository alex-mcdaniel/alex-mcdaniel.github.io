This page will eventually include some of the projects I worked on as part of the <a href="https://www.clemsongis.org/engineering-and-environmental-gis-s">GIS Fundamentals Workshop Series </a> I participated in at Clemson University. This workshop offered >30 hours of hands on training using ArcGISPro to explore various GIS topics.

In the meantime, you can find below the certificate awarded by the course.
